class DiscountedReturn(nn.Cell):
    r"""
    Calculate discounted return.

    Set discounted return as :math:`G`, discounted factor as :math:`\gamma`, reward as :math:`R`,
    timestep as :math:`t`, max timestep as :math:`N`. Then :math:`G_{t} = \Sigma_{t=0}^N{\gamma^tR_{t+1}}`

    For the reward sequence contain multi-episode, :math:`done` is introduced for indicating episode boundary,
    :math:`last\_state\_value` represents value after final step of last episode.

    Args:
        gamma (float): Discounted factor between [0, 1].
        need_bprop (bool): Whether need to calculate the backpropagation of discounted returns. Default: False.

    Inputs:
        - **reward** (Tensor) - The reward sequence contains multi-episode.
          Tensor of shape :math:`(Timestep, Batch, ...)`
        - **done** (Tensor) - The episode done flag. Tensor of shape :math:`(Timestep, Batch)`.
          The data type must be bool.
        - **last_state_value** (Tensor) - The value after final step of last episode.
          Tensor of shape :math:`(Batch, ...)`

    Returns:
        Discounted return.

    Examples:
        >>> net = DiscountedReturn(gamma=0.99)
        >>> reward = Tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1]], dtype=mindspore.float32)
        >>> done = Tensor([[False, False, True, False]])
        >>> last_state_value = Tensor([2.], dtype=mindspore.float32)
        >>> ret = net(reward, done, last_state_value)
        >>> print(output.shape)

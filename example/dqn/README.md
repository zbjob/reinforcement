## Game that this algorithm used

DQN uses  an open source reinforcement learning environment library called  [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) which is developed by OpenAI.

The game solved in DQN is [**CartPole-v0**](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/). "A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The system is controlled by applying a force of +1 or -1 to the cart. The pendulum starts upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over."[1](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/)

## How to run DQN

Before running DQN, you should first install [MindSpore](https://www.mindspore.cn/install) and MindSpore-Reinforcement. Besides, you should also install following dependencies. Please follow the instruction on the official website.

- MindSpore >= 1.5.0

- numpy >= 1.17.0
- matplotlib >=3.1.3
- [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) >= 0.18.3

After installation, you can directly use the following command to run the DQN algorithm.

For comprehensive performance considerations on CPU, it is recommended to set `OMP_NUM_THREADS` and configure a unified configuration to 1/4 of the number of physical cores, such as export `OMP_NUM_THREADS=32`(edit in `run_standalone_train.sh`).

### Train

```shell
> cd example/dqn/scripts
> bash run_standalone_train.sh [CKPT_PATH] [DEVICE_TARGET](optional)
```

You will obtain outputs which is similar with the things below in `log.txt`.

```shell

```shell
> cd example/dqn/scripts
> bash run_standalone_eval.sh [CKPT_FILE_PATH] [DEVICE_TARGET](optional)
```

You will obtain outputs which is similar with the things below in `log.txt`.

```shell
-----------------------------------------
Evaluation result is 199.300, checkpoint file is /path/ckpt/ckptpoint_600.ckpt
-----------------------------------------
```

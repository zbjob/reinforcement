CQL is a classical algorithm in Offline RL. Offline reinforcement learning needs to solve the problem of how to maximize the use of offline historical data to train agents (without interaction with the environment during the period), and finally apply it to the actual environment. Generally, the offline method has a fatal flaw: the overestimation of Q value caused by the difference between the offline data and the actual learning policy distribution, especially when the distribution of the actual environment and the training data is different (distribution offset), it will lead to the failure to correctly judge the training policy.
In this paper, a conservative Q-learning (CQL) algorithm is proposed, which aims to address these limitations by learning a conservative Q-function such that the expected value of a policy under this Q-function lower-bounds its true value.

## Game that this algorithm used

CQL uses an open source data of offline reinforcement learning [D4RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07219).
It provides a standardized environment and data set for training and benchmarking. The D4RL benchmark includes over 40 tasks across 7 qualitatively distinct domains that cover application areas such as robotic manipulation, navigation, and autonomous driving.

This demo using the default dataset `hopper-medium-expert-v0` in [D4RL](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/D4RL), Control environment needs [MuJoCo](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py) as a dependency. For more details of D4RL, please refer to the [website](https://sites.google.com/view/d4rl/home).

## How to run CQL

Before running CQL, you should first install [MindSpore](https://www.mindspore.cn/install) and MindSpore-Reinforcement. Besides, you should also install following dependencies. Please follow the instruction on the official website.

This example uses the offline data provided by [d4rl](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/d4rl) , you need to install d4rl:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/rail-berkeley/d4rl@master#egg=d4rl
```

- MindSpore >= 1.9.0
- Reinforcement >= 0.6
- numpy >= 1.17.0
- [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) >= 0.18.3
- [mujoco-py](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py)<2.2,>=2.1

After the installation is successful, you can directly run CQL by entering the following instructions.

### Training

Train 1e6 steps in the default configuration.

```shell
> cd example/cql/

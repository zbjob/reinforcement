## Game that this algorithm used

PPO uses  an open source reinforcement learning environment library called [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym), which is developed by OpenAI.

The game solved in PPO is called [**HalfCheetah-v2**](https://gym.openai.com/envs/HalfCheetah-v2/), it is from Gym, but this game depends on an advanced physics simulation called [MuJoCo](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py).

## How to run PPO

Before running PPO, you should first install [MindSpore](https://www.mindspore.cn/install) and MindSpore-Reinforcement. Besides, you should also install following dependencies. Please follow the instruction on the official website.

- MindSpore >= 1.5.0

- numpy >= 1.17.0
- matplotlib >=3.1.3
- [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) >= 0.18.3
- [mujoco-py](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py)<2.1,>=2.0

After installation, you can directly use the following command to run the PPO algorithm.

For comprehensive performance considerations on CPU, it is recommended to set `OMP_NUM_THREADS` and configure a unified configuration to 1/4 of the number of physical cores, such as export `OMP_NUM_THREADS=32`(edit in `run_standalone_train.sh`).

### Train

```shell
> cd example/ppo/scripts
> bash run_standalone_train.sh [CKPT_PATH] [DEVICE_TARGET](optional)
```

You will obtain outputs which is similar with the things below in `log.txt`.

### Eval

```shell
> cd example/ppo/scripts
> bash run_standalone_eval.sh [CKPT_FILE_PATH] [DEVICE_TARGET](optional)
```

You will obtain outputs which is similar with the things below in `log.txt`.

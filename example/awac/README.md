The AWAC algorithm was proposed by Sergey Levine team of UC Berkeley in 2020. It uses offline expert data to pre train and then fintune, which belongs to the category of offline reinforcement learning. The article points out that in the field of reinforcement learning robots, the cost of using online learning is too high. First, the cost of data collection is high, and the time cost of tens of thousands of training steps is high. Therefore, it is necessary to use offline data to accelerate convergence.

## Game that this algorithm used

AWAC uses an open source data of offline reinforcement learning [D4RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07219).
It provides a standardized environment and data set for training and benchmarking. The D4RL benchmark includes over 40 tasks across 7 qualitatively distinct domains that cover application areas such as robotic manipulation, navigation, and autonomous driving.

This demo using the default dataset `ant-expert-v0` in [D4RL](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/D4RL), Control environment needs [MuJoCo](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py) as a dependency. For more details of D4RL, please refer to the [website](https://sites.google.com/view/d4rl/home).

## How to run AWAC

Before running AWAC, you should first install [MindSpore](https://www.mindspore.cn/install) and MindSpore-Reinforcement. Besides, you should also install following dependencies. Please follow the instruction on the official website.

This example uses the offline data provided by [d4rl](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/d4rl) , you need to install d4rl:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/rail-berkeley/d4rl@master#egg=d4rl
```

- MindSpore >= 1.9.0
- Reinforcement >= 0.6
- numpy >= 1.17.0
- [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) >= 0.18.3
- [mujoco-py](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py)<2.2,>=2.1

After the installation is successful, you can directly run AWAC by entering the following instructions.

### Training

Train 500 episodes in the default configuration.

```shell
> cd example/awac/
> bash scripts/run_standalone_train.sh 500
```

You will get similar output as following in `example/awac/awac_train_log.txt`.

```shell
Episode 0: critic_loss is 0.955, actor_loss is 23433.918, mean_std is 0.063, per_step_time 14.688 ms

```

### Eval

```shell
> cd example/awac/
> bash scripts/run_standalone_eval.sh ./ckpt
```

You will get similar output as following in  `example/awac/awac_eval_log.txt`.

```shell
Load file  ./ckpt//policy/policy_500.ckpt
Load file  ./ckpt//value_net_1/model_1_500.ckpt
Load file  ./ckpt//value_net_2/model_2_500.ckpt
-----------------------------------------
Evaluate result is 5342.521, checkpoint file in ./ckpt/
-----------------------------------------
eval end
```
